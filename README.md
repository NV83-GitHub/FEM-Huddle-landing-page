It was fun, still one or two quirks i coudn't figure, for example in the _media_1440 i coudn't for the life of me change the font size of the h3
and the background image in desktop mode isn't quite right either, but everything else is working ok , the hover on the button and the ressemblance is ok and i am hungry now so..
it's all for today !
